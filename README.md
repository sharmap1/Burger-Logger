Following the MVC design pattern and using Node + MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML. Designed to be used as a communication tool for fellow developers in the community and potential employers.

## HOW TO USE:

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page
The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not
